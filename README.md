A Labyrinth is a tree-based maze in the Royal House of England where the royals often enjoyed themselves with their servants who would get in and find their way out of a labyrinth maze.

The purpose of this project is to implement a maze game that involves multiple mazes to play from. The game involves varied walls that restrict player movement and bombs that kills the player. 
The main purpose of such puzzles is not only entertainment but also teaching by increasing our knowledge and stimulating curiosity.
